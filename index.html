        <br>
        <h2>About us</h2><br>
        <p>It's October 2022.<br>
             Hi! I am Kinga. I live with my husband John and my 3 years old, JJ.<br>
        John has a full day time job and learning to be a full stack developer. I work in the weekends and one night midweek.<br>
        This way, somone is allways at home with little one, we can both spend time separatelly with JJ, and we can get a little bit of time together,when John is not at work or learning and when I am off from work.

        </p>
        <h2>
            GO!
        </h2>
        <p>
        I decided to go because:
        <ol>
            <li>I am a mum of a 3 year old- balance between work and family</li>
            <li>I work silly hours</li>
            <li>I want a career</li>
            <li>This is the future</li>
        </ol>
        <br>Now, let's break them down.</br>
        <br></br>
        1.<em>I am a mum of a 3 year old- balance between work and family</em><br>
        Everyone knows how much joy a child can bring to the family, but being a mum can be challanging at times.<br>
        One of the challanges is work. As we are not entitled to funded childcare from the Government, John works in the morning and I work weekends and occasionally midweek afternoon.<br>
        Full time work is just not an option for me now. It works out for us for <em>now</em>, the balance is in favour of JJ, that is the most important thing now.
        <br>
        2. <em>I work silly hours</em><br>
        Working in the weekends and sometimes midweek afternoon, means we are missing out on family activities. I miss spending time together. having a day out, is out of question unless me or John is on holyday.<br>
